The Wuhan lockdown and the Henan floods were significant public crises that caused severe damage in recent years. These events highlighted the potential of pan-media as an innovative response mechanism for emergencies, integrating ordinary citizens into the traditionally government-led rescue system. By forming a "mutual aid ecosystem", pan-media facilitates real-time feedback on rescue information and online rescue efforts alongside official on-site operations.

However, the spontaneous "mutual aid ecosystem" formed through social media has limitations, such as redundant data and difficulties in extracting valuable information. 

This project aims to develop a data platform model that collects, processes, and visualizes public emergency information from social media, providing a structured prototype system for more effective crisis response.

** The formation process of the "mutual aid ecosystem" on social media**: In the entire ecosystem, we can see that in addition to help-seekers, different roles such as information release or- ganizers, information classification volunteers, and network res- cuers have also been formed, with corresponding functions and tasks. This division of labor plays a significant impact in mutual aid.

** Posts forward distribution **: The overall distribution showed a long-tail distribution which indicates the exist of Pareto principle. A small amount of informa- tion receives a large amount of exposure and it lead to the decrease the efficiency of the rescue and wastes a lot of time and human resources.
