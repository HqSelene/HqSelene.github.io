立德18楼是我们实验室工位所在的地方，在准备作品集和做研究的这段时间，它是我待得时间最久的地方，在这里，我经常和朝阳、夕阳擦肩而过，偶然也会遇到彩虹。它作为我们学校最高的教学楼，你可以清楚的看到这个校园结构，看到密密麻麻的人群，看到远处的白云和蓝天。在这里，你可以看到天是蓝色的、红色的、也是紫色的。

The 18th floor of Lide is where our laboratory workstation is located. I stay there for preparing my portfolio and conduct my research. During this period, it was the place where I stayed the longest. Here, I often brushed past the sunrise and sunset, bumping into rainbow occasionally. As the tallest teaching building in our school, you can clearly see the layout of the campus, watch the crowd coming and go, and enjoy the distant white clouds and blue sky. Here, you can see that the sky is blue, red, and also purple.
